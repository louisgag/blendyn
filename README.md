# mbdyn-blender

Welcome to the **mbdyn-blender** github repository!

**mbdyn-blender** is a [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) add-on, written in
Python, that allows to import the output of the
[free](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) multibody solver
[MBDyn](https://www.mbdyn.org /) developed at the [Aerospace Science and
Technology Department](https://www.aero.polimi.it/) of [Politecnico di Milano
University](http://www.polimi.it/). [MBDyn](https://www.mbdyn.org/) does not
come with a built-in graphical pre- or post-processor, as it is able to process
text-only input files and generates either text or binary (in
[NetCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) format) output. The
purpose of the **mbdyn-blender** add-on is to exploit the numerous features of
the 3D graphics software [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) to post-process
[MBDyn](https://www.mbdyn.org /) output data. The add-on is, therefore, strictly
a post-processor, but the goal is to make it as useful as possible also during
the model definition phase.

Please refer to the [wiki pages](https://github.com/zanoni-mbdyn/mbdyn-blender/wiki) 
for the complete documentation of the add-on and the Change Log.
